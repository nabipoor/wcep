# wcep

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of wcep is to analyze time-to-event data with multiple events, for instance death and shock with related severity weights. The weight of death is always 1 and other events have a positive weight smaller than 1.

This package provides two main functions: wcep produce survival probabilities with related variances, and plot function uses survival probabilities to ilustrate Kaplan Meier curve with prespecified confidence interval. Also, it provides a dataset.

## Installation

You can install the released version of wcep from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wcep")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nabipoor/wcep")
```
## Example

Basic examples provided in the Help document.

```{r example}
library(wcep)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
